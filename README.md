ROOST App

Roost is an app that is designed for teachers that are teaching in person. 
Roost will help with the daily and daunting task of coming up with seating arrangements for students attending school.
Roost helps randomize seating charts and gives the ability to cusomize the number and rows of seats.
Roost also saves the seating arrangement for the day. 
If a student becomes sick, then the teacher must provide the seating arrangement displaying who the student sat next to in order to inform the parents, and principal.
Having this type of ease for a teacher is crucial more than ever in during this of a pandemic. 
This will allow the teacher to focus on other tasks rather than spending time re-working their seating chart for the day.
